The following are a set of step you can follow to generate an archive of falco-python and publish to test.PyPI and PYPI (I suggest you test it but publishing to test.PYPI first):
 
copy the attached file (pyproject.toml) to the folder ../falco-python
cd ../falco-python
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build  # upgrade build if needed
python3 -m build  # run this command in same directory where pyproject.toml is located, this command creates a distribution archive of the falco-python code in ./dist
cd dist/
ls -l (note: you will need to change the package_name parameter in the setup.cfg file to the name you want your package to be recognized by in PyPI, in this case I used package_name = pyfalco_test01)

cd ../                                                                                                 # cd back to falco-python
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine                          # upgrade twine which is used to upload all of the archives under dist
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*           # this uploads the distribution archive files to testPyPI, to load to PyPI change testpypi to pypi
go to testPyPI to see your package and you can use pip install to install it in your computer
